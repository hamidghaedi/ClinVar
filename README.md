# clinvar

To classify clinvar variants into two diffrent groups ("conflict", and "no-conflict") based on the variant annotations (original clinvar annotation + VEP annotation)

### Summary on the variants review status in ClinVar (*clinvar_20210619.vcf.gz*)



|     stars       | Review status  | number of variant   |Description |
| :-------------- |:--------------:|--------------------:|:----------|
|four	 | practice guideline	                                     |51  |    practice guideline |
|three	 | reviewed by expert panel	                               |11660 |  reviewed by expert panel |
|two	   |criteria provided, multiple submitter, no conflicts	  |138617  |  Two or more submitters with assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact) provided the same interpretation. |
|one	   | criteria provided, conflicting interpretations	         |49026  |  Multiple submitters provided assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact) but there are conflicting interpretations. The independent values are enumerated for clinical significance. |
|one	   |criteria provided, single submitter	                  |696333 |  One submitter provided an interpretation with assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact). |
|none	 | no assertion for the individual variant	              |   -  |   The allele was not interpreted directly in any submission; it was submitted to ClinVar only as a component of a haplotype or a genotype. |
|none	 | no assertion criteria provided	                         |53236 |  The allele was included in a submission with an interpretation but without assertion criteria and evidence (or a public contact). |
|none	 | no assertion provided	                                 |10653  | The allele was included in a submission that did not provide an interpretation. |
